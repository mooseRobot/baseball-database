# Baseball Database :baseball:

This repository contains a database project developed for a school assignment. The goal was to design a database to solve a specific problem. Our solution is a database that tracks baseball teams, their players, and the games they've played.

## :gear: Technologies

- **SQL**: For data hosting and management.
- **Handlebars**: As the templating engine.
- **Express**: For server-side logic.
- **Node.js**: To run the server.

## :rocket: Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine.
2. **Update the database credentials** in the appropriate fields with your MySQL username, password, and the name of the database you intend to use.
3. **Install the necessary dependencies** by running `npm install` in your terminal.
4. **Start the server** by running `node app.js` in your terminal.
5. **Set up the database** by creating the tables from the `ddl.sql` file before you are able to add data.

## :memo: Note

This project is part of a school assignment and is not intended for production use.
